/*************************************************************
 * Projects:
 * When you hand in a project - and in the beginning there
 * will be one project every few days - it MUST be handed in
 * on time.
 *
 * Please hand it in via git:
 *      AP2017/Your-Folder/Handins/Project-Name/
 *                                      FileName001.java
 *                                      FileName002.java
 *    etc.
 *
 *  Go to your editor (not an IDE... not yet!)
 *  Now - let's create our HelloWorld files (or find them)
 *  Go to your terminal.
 *  Navigate to your directory
 *  >> javac HelloWorld.java
 *  >> java HelloWorld
 *  Did it work? If not - let's get it working!
 *    Are there errors?
 *    Read the error messages! What do they say?
 *    Ask your friends for help!
 *    Google the error message
 *    Cry.
 *
 *  Now let's create a new folder in your Handins directory
 *  Copy your HelloWorld.java over to the new directory.
 *  Open it in your editor, and make some changes
 *  Go back to your terminal window and compile and run.
 *
 *  One of the most important things you are doing right
 *  now is organizing your stuff. Organization is 100%
 *  way, really, truely, like - I mean REALLY important!!!!
 *
 *  Name your program files something you will remember:
 *		For example: don't call it 'Project001.java'
 * 				better:    'HelloWorldVariations.java'
 *
 *  ALSO, as you run into errors, keep a file of them!!!!
 *  Call one file "CompileErrors" and another "RunErrors"
 *  I would suggest indexing them by the string the computer returns.
 *
